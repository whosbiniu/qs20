  Canonical trade model of the import pipeline. Every source format - pasted
  R-series, TradingView strategy exports, MetaTrader statements, generic
  broker/journal CSVs - is converted into ImportedTrade before anything else
  touches it, so source-specific assumptions never leak into the simulator.

  The pipeline never invents data: a field a source does not carry is null,
  and an R-multiple that cannot be derived from the file (plus an explicit,
  user-chosen RiskSpec) stays null with rSource "unavailable".

 *                 or P&L ÷ stop-distance risk).
 * - "inferred":   derived using a user-supplied RiskSpec (e.g. "I risked $50
 *                 per trade") because the file has P&L but no risk info.
 * - "unavailable": not derivable without fabricating a number; r stays null.
